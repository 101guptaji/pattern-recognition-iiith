Mean and Covariance

<div id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p> The locations at which the samples of a class can appear in the feature space can be
    statistically modeled using a distribution or density function. There are different
    properties of the density function that allows us to gain an understanding of the
    class under consideration. The most popular metrics are the <i>mean</i> and
    <i>variance</i> (or <i>covariance matrix</i>). In the case of normal densities,
    these two parameters completely characterize the density itself, and hence are
    denoted as the parameters of the density: N(mean,cov).</p>

     <p>In this experiment, we will try to gain an understanding of these metrics.
     Specifically, we need to understand the effect of these parameters on the shape
     of the data distribution under various assumptions of densities. This will allow
     us to visualize the nature of distribution, given the mean vector and the covariance matrix.</p>

    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>Given samples of a class, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ... x<sub>n</sub>, each
    being an d-dimensional vector, we define the mean, &#956, and the covariance matrix, &#931
    are defined as:</p>
    <p><img src="images/eqnmu.png" height="180"></p>
    <h3>Properties of &#956 and &#931</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Note that x<sub>i</sub>s are d-dimensional column vectors, and hence the mean, &#956, is
        also a d-dimensional column vector. The covariance matrix, &#931, is a dxd symmetric square
        matrix.
        </li>
        <li>The mean, &#956 is the centroid of the samples in the feature space.
        </li>
        <li>The covariance matrix, &#931 is a positive semi-definite matrix.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Objective </h2>
    <p>The high level goals of the experiment are:
        <ol>
            <li> <b>1:</b> To understand effect of changing the mean and covariance matrix on the distribution.</li>
            <li> <b>2:</b> To understand the effect of sampling on estimates of mean and covariance.</li>
            <li> <b>3:</b> To understand the implications of singularities on the distribution.</li>
            <li> <b>4:</b> To understand the generation of samples of a normal distribution with specific parameters.</li>
        </ol>

<div id="procedure">
    <h2> Procedure </h2>
    <p>
    The pane on the right allows you to specify the mean and covariance matrices for a set
    of samples in 2-dimensions.</p>
    <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Set the default parameters and click the generate button; Observe the
        dataset for multiple instances of samples. </li>
        <li> Click the estimate button to compute the mean and covariance of the generated samples;
        Observe the mismatch between the two. Repeat the process for multiple sets of samples generated
        from the same distribution and observe the variations in the estimate</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Repeat the above procedure for the different values for the number of generated samples. </li>
        <li> Plot a graph between the average error, and number of samples</li>
        <li> Note down your inferences regarding the graph</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stage 3:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Generate your own dataset by clicking on the plot area. Note that the distribution
        need not be similar to a normal density.</li>
        <li> Estimate the mean and covarance matrices</li>
        <li> Note down your inferences regarding the error committed if you assume the
        distribution to be normal.</li>
    </ol>
